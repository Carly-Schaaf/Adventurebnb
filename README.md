Welcome to Adventurebnb - my single-page clone of Airbnb. My web-app includes many of the features that can be found on the real Airbnb, including the ability to search for over 60 listings in 5 different cities, view their exact location via the Google Maps API, and book, edit, or cancel a booking at any of these listings.

The search feature works by converting user input into latitudinal and longitudinal coordinates (via Google's Geocoding API), which is then used as the center for the Google Map displayed on the results page. Once this map is loaded, I use the latitudinal and longitudinal coordinates of the perimeter of the map to fetch any listings in my database that fall within this perimter.

I built the map feature using the Google Maps API and Googleâ€™s Geocoding API - to turn locations into coordinates. Listings will dynamically appear and disappear based on the user's interaction with the map.

My listing show-page enables logged-in users to book a listing. Users can only book if another user has not already booked that date or any overlapping dates, and can only book for the number of guests that the listing allows for. I built my calendar feature using Airbnb's own calendar library, React-Dates.

Above, logged-in users can view their bookings as well as edit or cancel them. The edit-booking form pre-fills users' current reservation information for their reference when editing.

This project was designed and built in under two weeks.
